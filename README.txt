Like most of my stuff on Github this is not finished, since I have a tendency 
to keep adding stuff until the very day we start the next aducational project.

But unlike the the other projects this is faaar from done since it's such a big
project and I have a hard time finding time for it between other assignments.

The map editor part (SwiftUI) is all my work but the game engine part is not. The engine
is basically a partially completed and modified version of this: https://github.com/nicklockwood/RetroRampage.git
